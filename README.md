# Wireless Signal Strength on 2.4GHz (WSS24) dataset


## Overview

We used Ellisys Bluetooth Vanguard spectrum analyzer to measure and capture RSSI values on the 2.4GHz band at Shenzhen Baoan International Airport. The sampling interval we set is 100us and sampling duration time is 5 minutes. Please refer to the document SZ AIRPORT.pdf for the wireless data sampled indoor scenario.

## Download

Some of the original samples have been uploaded to this github repository, such as B.csv, C.csv, D.csv and G.csv. The remaining data need to be downloaded from the web site.
